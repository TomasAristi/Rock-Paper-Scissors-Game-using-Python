# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game-using-Python

To create and play rock paper scissors, I will be using the if and elif statements in Python. I will prepare this game to be played between two players. You and the PC. You will manually select the rock paper or scissor, while the PC will choose randomly. So I will also use the random module in Python to create this game.
